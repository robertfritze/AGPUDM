This project allows to address the G\+PU on Android devices using the Open\+CL framework. In contrast to other projects the Open\+CL library of the device is loaded only at runtime. There is no need to include it during the build process.

Two data mining algorithms (D\+B\+S\+C\+AN and Kmeans) have been implemented with two different programming languages and different programming paradigms (single-\/threaded, multi-\/threaded, task/data parallelism (G\+PU)).

There is a \href{app/doc/html/index.html}{\tt doxygen documentation} available for this project (see app/doc/html/index.\+html). As of 9/12/2021 only the C part (except dbscan\+\_\+c.\+c and kmeans\+\_\+c.\+c) has been included in this documentation. Additional documentation will be available soon.

The parameters for the data mining jobs have to be set in the file app/src/main/res/values/values.\+xml. The following attributes can be set\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries mode} (string)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}dynamic\char`\"{} multiple test are made with built in values. The attributes \textquotesingle{}clusterno\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}clustersize\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}features\textquotesingle{} must be set correctly but will not be used.
\item \char`\"{}fixed\char`\"{} tests are made with the attributes specified in this file
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries passes} (integer) Number of passes that should be made
\item {\bfseries threads} (integer) Number of threads that should be used for multithreaded implementations. Zero means the maximum number of available cores.
\item {\bfseries export} (boolean) \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} export results, \char`\"{}false\char`\"{} do not export results
\item {\bfseries append} (boolean) \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} append to old results if available, \char`\"{}false\char`\"{} delete old results
\item {\bfseries resultfilename} (string) Name of the csv-\/file in which to store the results. {\bfseries DO N\+OT P\+R\+E\+P\+E\+ND A P\+A\+T\+H!} The correct path will be prepended automatically. In the version for larger screen sizes the full path and name are shown in the info box.
\item {\bfseries log} (boolean) \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} log information, \char`\"{}false\char`\"{} do not log information (there is just one log-\/level)
\item {\bfseries logfilename} (string) Name of the text-\/file in which to store the results. {\bfseries DO N\+OT P\+R\+E\+P\+E\+ND A P\+A\+T\+H!} The correct path will be prepended automatically. In the version for larger screen sizes the full path and name are shown in the info box.
\item {\bfseries kmeanseps} Maximum cluster center displacement. If the sum of the absolute values of the cluster displacements drops below this threshold, the algorithm terminates.
\item {\bfseries dbscaneps} Search radius for D\+B\+S\+C\+AN (0=sqrt(features))
\item {\bfseries dbscanneigh} Minimum number of neighbours within the serach radius (0=10$\ast$features)
\item {\bfseries clusterno} Number of clusters to generate randomly. For Kmeans also the number of clusters to search for.
\item {\bfseries clustersize} Size of the clusters (equal size for all clusters).
\item {\bfseries features} Number of features for each data item.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In a future version an additional activity, that will allow to set the attributes on the device during runtime, will be added to this project.
