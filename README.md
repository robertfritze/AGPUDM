# AGPUDM
This project allows to address the GPU on Android devices using the OpenCL framework. Two data mining algorithms 
(DBSCAN and Kmeans) have been implemented with two different programming languages and different programming
paradigms (single-threaded, multi-threaded, task/data parallelism (GPU)).

There is a doxygen documentation available for this project (see app/doc/html/index.html). As of 9/11/2021 only the 
C-header files have been included in this documentation. Additional documentation will be available soon.
